# Introduction 
This is the project to track ideas and updates related to my coaching business.

# Getting Started
This is pretty much just for me to track my changes and have a redundant repo and a build process.
I plan to use:
- HTML, CSS and likely Vue (non-compiled)
- An azure function to send the emails of the site

# Build and Test
I'll be building the code and deploying it to Azure Static Web Sites

# Contribute
At this time no plans for anyone else to contribute

# TODO
- merge the changes to main
- use Azure dev ops to deploy to Azure
- join chamber
