                    We will support you with your goals like a traditional life coach, the difference however is our approach.
                    We believe the most effective way to support people is by focusing on all aspects of their lives. Achieving goals
                    in one area at the expense of another does not lead to long term wellness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using various tools and techniques we can help you
                    recognize what "wholeness" means to you and set action plans to move in that direction starting from where you are now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While not an exhaustive list, here are some things we can help with:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Empower you with tools, techniques and practices to live a balanced life</li>
                        <li>Overcome limiting beliefs</li>
                        <li>Heal core issues and negative patterns</li>
                        <li>Work in conjunction with your existing support systems</li>

                <p>
                    We break our focus into four body systems and work towards balance and wholeness in all of them. We'll help
                    you gather the tools and build the skills to live the life you want for yourself.

                <h3 class="content-subhead">Mental</h3>
                <p>
                    With the mental body system, we focus on the thought life, self-perceptions and thought patterns. Wellness in this area
                    focuses on our views of ourselves, those around us and the world.

                <h3 class="content-subhead">Emotional</h3>
                <p>
                    The emotional body system is our unconscious mind. Our feelings, emotions and relationships with ourselves and others.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Refers to our physical health and physical things we have or do not have in our lives. This can be the easiest area
                    to notice results. It can also be where issues from other areas surface.

                <h3 class="content-subhead">Spiritual</h3>
                <p>
                    The spirit or spiritual system refers to our true self, our personal development and connection to energy, God, or
                    whatever we consider as the divine. This area brings energy to all of the others.

                <p>A further note on the Spiritual body system.</p>
                <p>
                    Spiritual in this respect does not necessarily mean religion. Religion may be a specific way a person practices and
                    studies spiritual wellness, but it is not a requirement. I am happy to work with you whatever your spiritual practice
                    is, with the presupposition that we respect each other's world views without the expectation of adopting them for ourselves.
