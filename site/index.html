                    Ultimately, my goal is to help you live your fullest life, one which brings you fulfillment and satisfaction.

                    Discovering your path, getting reacquainted with it or taking on an unexpected shift? You don't have to
                    explore it alone. Partner with an experienced guide to help uncover ideas and directions you may not have
                    considered. Together we'll discuss alternative perspectives and identify habits and behaviors that are getting in the way.

                    Happiness is much more than pleasure, power or achievement. It also doesn't come easy, so let's work together
                    on five core things that have been shown to have an impact on happiness: emotional regulation, family,
                    friendship, work and faith/connection. It's all about practice and making the time for a better life.
                    Our modern world constantly pulls our attention to more immediate pleasures and creates distractions from
                    dealing with our pain. My coaching goes beyond immediate goals - it's an investment in your lifelong growth,
                    happiness and satisfaction.

                        The warrior’s approach is to say “yes” to life: “yes” to it all. We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy.
