                    I’m here to support business professionals with their performance, health and personal goals. When working
                    toward career and professional goals it can be all too easy to fall out of balance in other areas of our lives.
                    I know this story all too well. I found myself sacrificing my health, family and friend relationships and
                    unfortunately everything fun. All because I was reaching for something I thought I needed.
                    Eventually, it was too much, something had to change. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Things had gone on for too long, so my reaction was that of excited panic. I started changing
                    everything; nutrition, exercise patterns, hobbies, companies, you name it, I tried an alternative to what I was
                    already doing. Admittedly it was very much a brute-force process, I found some things that worked, some that
                    didn’t and some that have made an outsized difference in the way I live my life. Once I realized the benefits,
                    I decided to study coaching and to help others find balance in theirs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My hope is to support you in making your changes and likely without as much trial and error as I went through.
                    I thought the only way to make the personal changes I needed to make was alone, that isn’t the case, let’s form
                    a partnership and start defining and achieving those goals of yours. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Together we can make meaningful, lasting change in your life.
